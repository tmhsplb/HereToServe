<h3>How it Works for the Case Manager</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Case Manager enters client (and dependents, if any) into list of clients.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Case Manager creates Service Request for client (and each dependent, if any).</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Case Manager prints client voucher.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Case Manager reviews voucher with client and explains the DISCLAIMER.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Both client and case manager sign the voucher.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Case Manager watches as client Service Request progresses through stages at Operation ID.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Case Manager redeeems voucher for checks at Operation ID when client reaches Done stage.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Case Manager delivers check(s) to client.</strong></li>
</ul>
<br />
<h3>How it Works for Operation ID</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Operation ID monitors a dashboard of client Service Requests.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Operation ID sends an ACK upon the receipt of a client Service Request.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Operation ID evaluates elegibility of each client Service Request.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>A client may be ineligible for an ID request (XID) or ineligible for a BC request (XBC) or both.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>An eligible client Service Request will be sent to the Operation ID Finance Office for a check (or checks) to be cut.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>When a client Service Request is completed, Operation ID will set the client's stage to Done.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Operation ID will release client check(s) to a Case Manager in exchange for a signed voucher.</strong></li>
</ul>
